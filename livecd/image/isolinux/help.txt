                                             * At the  boot  screen,  use the
                                               UP/DOWN arrows and  ENTER  key
                                               to select your boot mode; some
                                               systems  may  only run  in one
                                               particular mode

                                             * Some machines boot much slower
                                               than others, and older systems
                                               may take up to five minutes to
                                               load and show the interface

 * If you have trouble getting your display to work properly, select the safe
   mode option and manually set a screen mode that is known to work with your
   video card and/or monitor

 * Remember that hardware support is limited to that of Ubuntu, and that your
   hardware must be compatible with Ubuntu in order to work with Redo Backup

 * There are a multitude of boot options available for Ubuntu, which may help
   your specific hardware run -- search online for "ubuntu boot options"
