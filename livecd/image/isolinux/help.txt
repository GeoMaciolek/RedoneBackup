                                              Press <ESC> to exit boot help.

                                             * At the  boot  screen,  use the
                                               UP/DOWN arrows and  ENTER  key
                                               to select  a boot mode.   Some
                                               systems  may  only  run in one
                                               particular mode.

                                             * Some machines boot much slower
                                               than others, and older systems
                                               may take up to five minutes to
                                               load and display the program.

 * Although the screen may not change during boot, it is loading.   Check the
   CD-ROM or USB drive lights for activity; they are likely busy working.

 * Try Enhanced video mode for maximum performance and screen  resolution  on
   your system.   This attempts to load a driver for your specific video card
   while Standard mode loads a generic driver that works with most hardware.

 * To change the keymap, select the mode you wish to load, and then press the
   <TAB> key to edit the keymap and language codes as needed.
